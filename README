Extracting read specific information from a bam file.

Currently the bam format is the format of choice for saving read information from NGS sequencing runs. Using samtools, the suite of software written to handle bam/sam files, one can easily extract read information from a large bam file in seconds. You just type …
samtools view chr1:100 - 10000
and thats it!

This works great when you want to find the reads which map to a certain region in the genome. But sometimes (mainly when I play with multi mapped reads) I want to do the opposite. i.e. Find out the genomic regions where one or more reads map to. It turns out (at least as far as I know), there is no straight forward way of going it.

This is my attempt to solve the problem.

Design requirements:
1. Fast read information retrieval
2. Small data / index files

My workflow for this has three steps.
1. Creating the index file and the read centered data file.

samtools view yourbam.bam | python makeReadIndex.py ReadKey.txt Index.db
#files:
yourbam.bam - multimapped bam file
ReadKey.txt - main key centered data file
Index.db - sqlite3 database containing the index
Performance - 2.5 minutes to process a 580MB bam file and produces 

2. Gzip the main data file
gzip ReadKey.txt 
#I could have added this step to step 1, but sometimes a plain text data file is needed to eyeball the data.
#takes 2 mins for compression

3.Get Reads!

python getReads.py ReadKey.txt.gz Index.db readID
#readID can be a single read_name or a comma separated list.
