#SamReadExtract [BIOINFORMATICS] - Extracting read specific information from a bam file.

Currently the bam format is the format of choice for saving read information from NGS sequencing runs. Using samtools, the suite of software written to handle bam/sam files, one can easily extract read information from a large bam file in seconds. You just type

samtools view chr1:100 - 10000

and thats it!

This works great when you want to find the reads which map to a certain region in the genome. But sometimes (mainly when I play with multi mapped reads) I want to do the opposite. i.e. Find out the genomic regions where one or more reads map to. It turns out (at least as far as I know), there is no straight forward way of going it.

**This is my attempt to solve the problem.**

**Design requirements:**
1. Fast read information retrieval
2. Small data / index files

## The process
### Step 1. Creating the index file and the read centered data file using makeReadIndex.py.
~~~
samtools view yourbam.bam | python makeReadIndex.py ReadKey.txt Index.db

files:
yourbam.bam - multimapped bam file
ReadKey.txt - main key centered data file
Index.db - sqlite3 database containing the index

~~~
Performance - 2.5 minutes to process a 580MB bam file and produces on a two core mac.

### Step 2: Gzip the main data file
~~~
gzip ReadKey.txt 
~~~
(2 mins for compression)

*I could have added this step to step 1, but sometimes a plain text data file is needed to eyeball the data.*

### Step 3: Find multimap read locations.
You can specify a single read or a comma seperated list of reads.
